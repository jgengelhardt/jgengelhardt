## Professional Business Data Analysis Work
I led an impactful project where I was able to determine that a significant amount of our summer revenue comes from customers who register for multiple programs to experience a multiple themes and don't seem to be landlocked as previously suspected. I recommended actions to management from these findings which helped ensure a strong ROI during the COVID-19 pandemic. While most of the data is proprietary, I share the scripting I wrote here.
* Gathering & Cleaning
* * The database doesn't allow us to pull all of the required records at once, so [this script](https://github.com/jgengelhardt/work-stuff/blob/main/combine_all2.py) combines and normalizes many compatible spreadsheets into a single record that can be analyzed.
* Analysis
* * [This script](https://github.com/jgengelhardt/work-stuff/blob/main/multiregistration_campers.ipynb) demonstrates some of the analysis that revealed actionable insights regarding what our customers want out of our summer operations.

## Sports Data Analysis
Also viewable here are some personal projects that showcase additional tools and techniques, including web scraping and data visualization. Documentation for each project is available through the links below.
### How well do final season standings represent team skill, rather than chance? 
In my project ["Win Percentage vs. Skill](https://github.com/jgengelhardt/wpct-vs-chance), I explore the above question for a number of sports leagues have through their recorded history, from their founding to the most recent available season. For the source data, I gathered sports statistics from several sources---scraping from various HTML webpages and querying the official NHL API---each with their own quirks and challenges. I then transformed and plotted the data, while performing linear regression for easy interpretation.
### Estimating Exponent for Pythagorean Method of Expected Win Percentage in Various Leagues
If you've read *Moneyball* or seen the movie starring Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill, then you might know that there's a simple formula analysts use to predict a baseball team's future performance. In [this project](https://github.com/jgengelhardt/sports-pythagorean-exponent), I query data from the official NHL API and perform linear regression and other analysis to estimate the equivalent formula for North American ice hockey.
